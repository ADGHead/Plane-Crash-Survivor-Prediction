The aircraft swerved off the left side of the runway colliding with a drainage ditch and coming to rest inverted. Examination of the fuel control unit revealed that the bellows within the assembly were found in an extended position, indicating a leak into the evacuated area. A failure was noted at the seam in the bellows. In addition, examination of the propeller revealed that the start locks were engaged and the blades were at the start lock position at impact. In order to engage the start locks, the power lever has to be moved to reverse during shutdown with the engine rpm below 50%. After engine start the pilot must again retard the power levers to reverse to disengage the start locks. The locks will not disengage after the power lever is set to the flight range.\",\n          \"The airplane was flown from Morgantown to Charleston to drop off passengers. Once there, the pilot called the mechanic who was scheduled to replace the right transfer pump, and told him the right boost pump was also inoperative. The mechanic told the pilot, he would replace both pumps the next morning in Charleston. Adding that de-fueling the airplane would take longer than changing the pumps. The mechanic recalled that the pilot was concerned about the amount of time necessary for the repair. The airplane was then repositioned back to Morgantown for another flight the next day to Charleston. The morning of the accident, the airplane departed Morgantown, and was being vectored for the ILS approach to Charleston when the copilot declared an emergency. He then announced that they had 'a dual engine failure, two souls onboard and zero fuel.' Examination of the wreckage and both engines revealed no pre-impact failures or malfunctions. With the right transfer pump inoperative. 28 gallons of fuel in the right wing would be unusable. In addition, the flight manual states that 'both boost pumps must be operable prior to take-off.'\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Crash cause\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Technical failure\",\n          \"Unknown\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":37}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["plane_data.drop(columns = [\"Registration\",\"index\", \"Crew fatalities\", \"Total fatalities\" ], inplace = True) # Dropping the columns that would not be used in the prediction"],"metadata":{"id":"07_LHrCrnYqO","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1711197922912,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"Ahmed Babatunde","userId":"18106494487626818338"}}},"execution_count":38,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["plane_data"],"metadata":{"id":"kxhQc3dKpzDS","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1711197923910,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":1000,"user":{"displayName":"Ahmed Babatunde","userId":"18106494487626818338"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"outputId":"093d6085-6b59-4a57-f895-88eac9c0d0ae"},"execution_count":39,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["       Year                              Aircraft  \\\n","0      1918                     De Havilland DH.4   \n","1      1918                   Handley Page V/1500   \n","2      1918                              Avro 504   \n","3      1918                     De Havilland DH.4   \n","4      1918                            Fairey III   \n","...     ...                                   ...   \n","26076  2022           Embraer EMB-110 Bandeirante   \n","26077  2022  Piper PA-61 Aerostar (Ted Smith 601)   \n","26078  2022              De Havilland DHC-3 Otter   \n","26079  2022         De Havilland DHC-6 Twin Otter   \n","26080  2022             Cessna 208B Grand Caravan   \n","\n","                                Operator                   Flight phase  \\\n","0      United States Signal Corps -

The aircraft swerved off the left side of the runway colliding with a drainage ditch and coming to rest inverted. Examination of the fuel control unit revealed that the bellows within the assembly were found in an extended position, indicating a leak into the evacuated area. A failure was noted at the seam in the bellows. In addition, examination of the propeller revealed that the start locks were engaged and the blades were at the start lock position at impact. In order to engage the start locks, the power lever has to be moved to reverse during shutdown with the engine rpm below 50%. After engine start the pilot must again retard the power levers to reverse to disengage the start locks. The locks will not disengage after the power lever is set to the flight range.\",\n          \"The airplane was flown from Morgantown to Charleston to drop off passengers. Once there, the pilot called the mechanic who was scheduled to replace the right transfer pump, and told him the right boost pump was also inoperative. The mechanic told the pilot, he would replace both pumps the next morning in Charleston. Adding that de-fueling the airplane would take longer than changing the pumps. The mechanic recalled that the pilot was concerned about the amount of time necessary for the repair. The airplane was then repositioned back to Morgantown for another flight the next day to Charleston. The morning of the accident, the airplane departed Morgantown, and was being vectored for the ILS approach to Charleston when the copilot declared an emergency. He then announced that they had 'a dual engine failure, two souls onboard and zero fuel.' Examination of the wreckage and both engines revealed no pre-impact failures or malfunctions.

The aircraft swerved off the left side of the runway colliding with a drainage ditch and coming to rest inverted. Examination of the fuel control unit revealed that the bellows within the assembly were found in an extended position, indicating a leak into the evacuated area. A failure was noted at the seam in the bellows. In addition, examination of the propeller revealed that the start locks were engaged and the blades were at the start lock position at impact. In order to engage the start locks, the power lever has to be moved to reverse during shutdown with the engine rpm below 50%. After engine start the pilot must again retard the power levers to reverse to disengage the start locks. The locks will not disengage after the power lever is set to the flight range.\",\n          \"The airplane was flown from Morgantown to Charleston to drop off passengers. Once there, the pilot called the mechanic who was scheduled to replace the right transfer pump, and told him the right boost pump was also inoperative. The mechanic told the pilot, he would replace both pumps the next morning in Charleston. Adding that de-fueling the airplane would take longer than changing the pumps. The mechanic recalled that the pilot was concerned about the amount of time necessary for the repair. The airplane was then repositioned back to Morgantown for another flight the next day to Charleston. The morning of the accident, the airplane departed Morgantown, and was being vectored for the ILS approach to Charleston when the copilot declared an emergency. He then announced that they had 'a dual engine failure, two souls onboard and zero fuel.' Examination of the wreckage and both engines revealed no pre-impact failures or malfunctions.

The aircraft swerved off the left side of the runway colliding with a drainage ditch and coming to rest inverted. Examination of the fuel control unit revealed that the bellows within the assembly were found in an extended position, indicating a leak into the evacuated area. A failure was noted at the seam in the bellows. In addition, examination of the propeller revealed that the start locks were engaged and the blades were at the start lock position at impact. In order to engage the start locks, the power lever has to be moved to reverse during shutdown with the engine rpm below 50%. After engine start the pilot must again retard the power levers to reverse to disengage the start locks. The locks will not disengage after the power lever is set to the flight range.\",\n          \"The airplane was flown from Morgantown to Charleston to drop off passengers. Once there, the pilot called the mechanic who was scheduled to replace the right transfer pump, and told him the right boost pump was also inoperative. The mechanic told the pilot, he would replace both pumps the next morning in Charleston. Adding that de-fueling the airplane would take longer than changing the pumps. The mechanic recalled that the pilot was concerned about the amount of time necessary for the repair. The airplane was then repositioned back to Morgantown for another flight the next day to Charleston. The morning of the accident, the airplane departed Morgantown, and was being vectored for the ILS approach to Charleston when the copilot declared an emergency. He then announced that they had 'a dual engine failure, two souls onboard and zero fuel.' Examination of the wreckage and both engines revealed no pre-impact failures or malfunctions. With the right transfer pump inoperative. 28 gallons of fuel in the right wing would be unusable. In addition, the flight manual states that 'both boost pumps must be operable prior to take-off.'\",\n          \"En route from Podkamennaya Tunguska to Turukhansk, after passing over Imbatsk, the aircraft disappeared and was lost without trace.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Crash cause\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Technical failure\",\n          \"Unknown\",\n          \"Terrorism act, Hijacking, Sabotage\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"survivors\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Yes\",\n          \"No\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":43}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["plane_data.rename({\"survivors\":\"Survivors\"}, axis = 1, inplace = True) # Renaming the surviors column into Survivors"],"metadata":{"id":"gVcxO_ztv0_N","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1711197926026,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"Ahmed Babatunde","userId":"18106494487626818338"}}},"execution_count":44,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Feature Engineering stage : Data Preprocessing\n","#Converting the category column to numerical values: Yes = 1, No = 0\n","mapping = {\"Yes\" : 1, \"No\" : 0}\n","#converting categorical string values to numeric values using map() function\n","plane_data[\"Survivors\"] = plane_data[\"Survivors\"].map(mapping)"],"metadata":{"id":"0hASUwOOvatn","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1711197926026,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"Ahmed Babatunde","userId":"18106494487626818338"}}},"execution_count":45,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["plane_data"],"metadata":{"id":"TYcI8jSmv8br","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1711197926796,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":777,"user":{"displayName":"Ahmed Babatunde","userId":"18106494487626818338"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":597},"outputId":"b0f08756-290b-4c06-95f7-f1e4cb7d8f59"},"execution_count":46,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                   Aircraft  \\\n","0                         De Havilland DH.4   \n","1                       Handley Page V/1500   \n","2                                  Avro 504   \n","3                         De Havilland DH.4   \n","4                                Fairey III   \n","...                                     ...   \n","26076           Embraer EMB-110 Bandeirante   \n","26077  Piper PA-61 Aerostar (Ted Smith 601)   \n","26078              De Havilland DHC-3 Otter   \n","26079         De Havilland DHC-6 Twin Otter   \n","26080             Cessna 208B Grand Caravan   \n","\n","                                Operator                   Flight phase  \\\n","0      United States Signal Corps - USSC                Takeoff (climb)   \n","1      Handley Page Aircraft Company Ltd                Takeoff (climb)   \n","2                  Royal Air Force - RAF                         Flight   \n","3      United States Signal Corps - USSC                         Flight   \n","4                 Marine Aeroplane Depot  Landing (descent or approach)   \n","...                                  ...                            ...   \n","26076              Sales Serviços Aéreos  Landing (descent or approach)   \n","26077               Raul Ignacion Posada                         Flight   \n","26078           Yakutat Coastal Airlines  Landing (descent or approach)   \n","26079                           Tara Air                         Flight   \n","26080                   GoJump Oceanside  Landing (descent or approach)   \n","\n","                                           Circumstances        Crash cause  \\\n","0      The single engine airplane departed Dayton-McC...

The aircraft swerved off the left side of the runway colliding with a drainage ditch and coming to rest inverted. Examination of the fuel control unit revealed that the bellows within the assembly were found in an extended position, indicating a leak into the evacuated area. A failure was noted at the seam in the bellows. In addition, examination of the propeller revealed that the start locks were engaged and the blades were at the start lock position at impact. In order to engage the start locks, the power lever has to be moved to reverse during shutdown with the engine rpm below 50%. After engine start the pilot must again retard the power levers to reverse to disengage the start locks. The locks will not disengage after the power lever is set to the flight range.\",\n          \"The airplane was flown from Morgantown to Charleston to drop off passengers. Once there, the pilot called the mechanic who was scheduled to replace the right transfer pump, and told him the right boost pump was also inoperative. The mechanic told the pilot, he would replace both pumps the next morning in Charleston. Adding that de-fueling the airplane would take longer than changing the pumps. The mechanic recalled that the pilot was concerned about the amount of time necessary for the repair. The airplane was then repositioned back to Morgantown for another flight the next day to Charleston. The morning of the accident, the airplane departed Morgantown, and was being vectored for the ILS approach to Charleston when the copilot declared an emergency. He then announced that they had 'a dual engine failure, two souls onboard and zero fuel.' Examination of the wreckage and both engines revealed no pre-impact failures or malfunctions. With the right transfer pump inoperative. 28 gallons of fuel in the right wing would be unusable. In addition, the flight manual states that 'both boost pumps must be operable prior to take-off.'\",\n          \"En route from Podkamennaya Tunguska to Turukhansk, after passing over Imbatsk, the
